# 🌐 Domain Takeover Demo

**🚨 Imagine this:**  
Your website looks fine, but suddenly, someone else controls part of it. Scary, right?  
This is what **Domain Takeover** is all about. This project showcases how this happens and why you should care.

## 🎯 What Is Domain Takeover?

> **In simple terms:**  
When you leave a door unlocked (like a misconfigured DNS record), someone else can walk in and take control!  
This happens when a domain or subdomain points to a third-party service that isn't set up properly.  

### ✨ The Result?  
- 🛑 **Your brand looks untrustworthy.**  
- 💻 **Hackers display whatever they want on your domain.**  
- 📉 **Users lose trust in your site.**
